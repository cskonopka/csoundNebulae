GENDYN (Génération Dynamique Stochastique)
	Implementation of the Génération Dynamique Stochastique (GENDYN),
	a dynamic stochastic approach to waveform synthesis conceived 
	by Iannis Xenakis.

The waveform is generated by knum - 1 segments and is repeated 
in the time. The vertexes (control points) are moved according 
to a stochastic action and they are limited within the boundaries 
of a mirror formed by an amplitude barrier and a time barrier.
